00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,847
A force of twenty newtons is applied to a string wrapped around

2
00:00:04,947 --> 00:00:09,795
a wheel of radius zero point two meters. This produces a torque

3
00:00:09,895 --> 00:00:15,292
equal to force times radius, which is four newton meters. Using torque

4
00:00:15,392 --> 00:00:22,125
equals moment of inertia times angular acceleration, the angular acceleration is twenty

5
00:00:22,225 --> 00:00:28,329
radians per second squared. Starting from rest, the angular velocity after five

6
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:31,628
seconds is one hundred radians per second.
