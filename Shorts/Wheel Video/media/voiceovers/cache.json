A force of twenty newtons is applied tangentially to the string. This force produces a torque equal to force times radius.The torque is therefore four newton meters. Using Newton\u2019s second law for rotation, torque equals moment of inertia times angular acceleration. This gives an angular acceleration of twenty radians per second squared. Since the wheel starts from rest, the angular velocity after five seconds is alpha times t, which is equal to one hundred radians per second.",
