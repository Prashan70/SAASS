1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,170
An object of mass zero point two kilograms executes simple harmonic motion

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,916
along the x axis with frequency twenty five by pi hertz.

3
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:17,847
At position x equals zero point zero four meters,

4
00:00:17,947 --> 00:00:21,698
the kinetic energy is zero point five joules and

5
00:00:21,798 --> 00:00:25,148
potential energy is zero point four joules.

6
00:00:25,248 --> 00:00:29,156
The total energy in simple harmonic motion is

7
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:33,164
equal to one half, omega squared, A, squared.

8
00:00:33,248 --> 00:00:39,676
Therefore, A, equals square root of two E, over m, omega squared.

9
00:00:39,764 --> 00:00:43,567
Angular frequency omega, equals two pi f.

10
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:48,232
Therefore, omega equals fifty radians per second.

11
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:53,919
The total energy equals zero point nine joules. Substituting the values

12
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:59,367
into the equation gives amplitude equals zero point zero six meters.

13
00:00:59,464 --> 00:01:05,268
Therefore, the amplitude of oscillation is zero point zero six meters.
