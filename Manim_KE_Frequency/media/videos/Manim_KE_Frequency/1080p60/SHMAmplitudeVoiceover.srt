1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,969
Let's solve a problem on simple harmonic

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:06,500
motion involving kinetic and potential energy.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,074
An object of mass zero point two kilograms executes SHM

4
00:00:11,174 --> 00:00:15,150
along the x axis with frequency twenty five by pi

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:20,390
hertz. At displacement zero point zero four meters, its kinetic

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,048
energy is zero point five joules and potential energy is

7
00:00:25,148 --> 00:00:29,540
zero point four joules. We have to find the amplitude.

8
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:36,223
The particle performs simple harmonic motion about the equilibrium position. The

9
00:00:36,323 --> 00:00:40,349
total energy is the sum of kinetic and potential energies.

10
00:00:40,433 --> 00:00:45,191
In simple harmonic motion, total energy is equal to kinetic

11
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:49,885
plus potential energy, which equals one half k A squared.

12
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:53,508
From the given data, kinetic plus potential

13
00:00:53,608 --> 00:00:56,627
energy equals zero point nine joules.

14
00:00:56,716 --> 00:01:02,952
We know that k equals m omega squared, and omega equals two pi f.

15
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,985
Substituting f equals twenty five by pi, we get omega equals

16
00:01:08,085 --> 00:01:12,937
fifty radians per second, and hence k equals zero point two

17
00:01:13,037 --> 00:01:17,806
times fifty squared equals five hundred newtons per meter.

18
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,983
Now using the relation for total energy, we have zero

19
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:26,167
point nine equals one half times five hundred times A

20
00:01:26,267 --> 00:01:31,456
squared. Solving gives amplitude equals zero point zero six meters.

21
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,826
Hence, the amplitude of motion is zero point zero six meters.
