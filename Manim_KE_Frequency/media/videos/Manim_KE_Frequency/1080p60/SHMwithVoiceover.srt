00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,465
This animation shows simple harmonic motion and

2
00:00:03,565 --> 00:00:06,956
the variation of kinetic and potential energy.

3
00:00:07,056 --> 00:00:09,479
A particle moves to and fro about

4
00:00:09,579 --> 00:00:13,916
an equilibrium position performing simple harmonic motion.

5
00:00:15,016 --> 00:00:20,676
As the particle moves, kinetic and potential energies vary with time.

6
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:27,311
Let us understand this mathematically. The displacement of the particle in simple

7
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:31,572
harmonic motion is given by x equals A, cos omega t.

8
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:36,095
Omega which represents angular frequency is two pi f.

9
00:00:36,659 --> 00:00:41,767
So we can represent the displacement A, cos two pi f t.

10
00:00:41,867 --> 00:00:47,751
Differentiating with respect to time gives the velocity, v, equals

11
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:50,743
minus two pi f A sine two pi f t.

12
00:00:50,834 --> 00:00:58,414
Kinetic energy is half, m, v squared, so substituting for, v, we get.

13
00:00:58,514 --> 00:01:03,446
Using the trigonometric identity sine squared theta equals

14
00:01:03,546 --> 00:01:06,310
one minus cos two theta over two.

15
00:01:06,410 --> 00:01:12,038
So we can say that the kinetic energy is proportional to one minus cos

16
00:01:12,138 --> 00:01:17,686
four pi f t over two, which means new angular frequency is two omega.

17
00:01:17,776 --> 00:01:23,040
This shows that the kinetic energy varies with time with a frequency

18
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,748
of four pi f divided by two pi, which is two f.

19
00:01:26,848 --> 00:01:31,716
Therefore, the kinetic energy oscillates with frequency two f.
